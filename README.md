# ATL Marathon 2021: Team Anokha

We are Team Anokha from Greenway Modern School, Dilshad Garden Delhi-95. We are taking part in the ATL Marathon 2021. Our team members are Sai Santosh Pal, Shorya Malik and Chinmayee Panda under the guidance of Mrs. Shruti Barman ma’am and Mrs. Nancy Gupta ma’am they guided us in every step, they had a crucial importance in our project.

The topic we chose is Energy & Transport and our project is about traffic management using AI. The programming languages we chose is python because of its interpreter-type console and libraries for vehicle detection.

It took us around 40 days to generate an idea and we spent 14 days to make it. It was not possible without the help of our respected teachers and the cooperation with our team members

Our idea was to create a traffic light which could detect vehicles around the lane so that there will be no wastage of time and no accidents will happen. It was difficult but we managed to do that.
